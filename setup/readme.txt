Shutdown forcer for Windows 9x/2000
-----------------------------------

Info
----
shut2ooo is a shutdown forcer for Windows 9x/2000, which really works because it's based on a Microsoft documented issue on the ExitWindowsEx function. Usage is preety simple. shut2ooo behaves like a command-line application. All you have to do is to run shut2ooo executable with one of the command-line switches:
	-L    <Log off>
	-R    <Restart>
	-S   <Shut down>

The easiest way to do this from Windows is to create a shortcut to shut2ooo.exe and to add a switch in target box after the quotes and a trailing space.
Ofcourse, setup program does this all by itself. In standard installation option are included five shortcuts:

Shortcut name	Keyboard shortcut		Action
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Log off		Shift + Control + Alt + L	Log off
Restart		Shift + Control + Alt + R	Restart
Shut down	Shift + Control + Alt + S	Shut down
shut2ooo	Shift + Control + Alt + X	Option box (no switch)

If shut2ooo is ran without any switch it displays a short help on command-line switches which are actually action buttons and about info. In this window just click on desired button.

Installation
------------
Just run the shut2ooo.exe to start the shut2ooo Setup, and follow instructions on the screen.
Setup is powered by Nullsoft SuperPiMP™ Install System.
